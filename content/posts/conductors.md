I don't know much about orchestra and conducting, however I sang in a boy's choir when I was a child and since then I have admiration for orchestras and I like classical music.


This is Georges Prêtre conducting the Vienna New Year's Concert in 2010. 
I like how he is enjoying the music and sometimes is not conducting at all but only listening.
Then, watch the end, Prêtre being 85 years old, he can still explode!

Gustavo Dudamel and Dvorak's New World Symphony, IV. Allegro con fuoco. Dudamel showing the pope what con fuoco really means.
This video always makes me happy.

I remember we learned about this symphony in music class in school and our teacher told us that Dvorak was fascinated by the railway and the first bars are actually a steam locomotive starting to accelerate. 
In the series "Mozart in the Jungle", which I have not seen yet, the conductor is based on Gustavo Dudamel. I heard that it shows well how important the conductor really is. 


In the next video I don't understand anything.
Why do the singers always look at each other?
Pieter Jan Leusink's conducting style is funny, but also a little .. offensive?
We also sang Mozart's requiem, and I remember our conductor telling us that Dies Irae means Day of Wrath.

It seems that they don't take it perfectly serious. But that's a good thing, I believe. Classical music is still very formal.

Again Vienna New Year's Concert, this time Barenboim and Radetzky March.
There is one strange thing happening at 0:55 when the violinist(?) rejects to shake hands and Barenboim steals his bow.
Barenboim then signals to start (how do you call this?) and another violinist borrows his bow immediately! How fast can you react?
Other questions:
In which order does Barenboim shake the hands?
How does he make sure not to forget anybody?

They seem to like him.
