TLDR: For technical (and political) discussions: async communication > sync communication


After reading [this post](https://www.peachesnstink.com/p/qXTsFiabnMT4rWpdMd9W6n) on Hacker News yesterday I agreed mostly to the post, then I read the comments. Many people seem not to agree.


I feel much more confident in async communication, when discussing technical problems (or political discussions). Maybe it is because I am not so good at giving good speedy answers. Often I find good answers after the conversation has ended (same with jokes, [L'esprit de l'escalier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27esprit_de_l%27escalier) or in German: Treppenwitz (staircase wit)).

Of course for some things synchronous communication works better: Telling a story, explaining something (one can immediately ask questions). And important things are better told in a phone call.

For difficult discussions I prefer asynchronous communication.
However we lack a suitable tool for async communication (at work we use MS Outlook, Emails, Top Posting). Recently we started using GitLab, which makes threaded discussions easier, however it is not broadly used yet.


The reality at my job looks like this:

- Most project communication is done by email. 
- In projects we have to archive emails. 
- Archiving is done by saving them into shared network directories, one folder per person, then renaming the email to something like i210617_RE:Some_subject (ingoing on 17.06.2021 with subject).

Everyone agrees that this is bad practice. 
What makes it even worse: 
- Encrypted emails (you can remove the encryption, but please not by sending it to yourself unencrypted) 
- Archiving every email vs. Archiving the last email of one topic (how to know which is last?)
- Attachments (save them seperately?)
- Whose responsibility is it to archive? Sender? Receiver? What if CC'ed?
- Grepping emails sucks
